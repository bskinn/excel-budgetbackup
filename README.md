# Budget Backup Manager -- Excel VBA Add-In

Proposal budgets and other quotations often require curation of 
evidence supporting the prices used for each line item. Carrying
out this curation process in an organized way can be agonizingly
slow, requiring lots of manual effort: repeated renaming of files,
opening and closing files to retrieve line item information and
prices, and so on.

This tool streamlines the whole process.  Simply name the various
files with the vendor, line item description, and pricing
information included according to a specific format, and
Budget Backup Manager will both
organize the files themselves *and* automatically generate a
summary spreadsheet to accompany them.
